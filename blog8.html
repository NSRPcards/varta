            <p>There is still a fear that contagion risks are uncomfortably elevated.<br>
                A troika of the Fed, Treasury and regulators stepped in to help calm nerves in the wake of the Silicon
                Valley Bank (SVB) collapse. SVB is an outlier in many ways, but it is too early to call the all-clear on
                the sector; it’s a risk from the aggressive rate-hiking environment. So far the system looks fine, but
                it needs to be treated with caution ahead, just in case.<br>
                The demise of Silicon Valley Bank was fast, super fast. It started on Wednesday as SVB took a US$1.8bn
                loss on a forced USD$21bn bond liquidation from its available-for-sale portfolio; it then announced an
                intention to raise US$2.25bn in capital to help plug the gap.<br>
                Thursday then saw material deposit outflows, and the SVB stock collapsed. Inevitably, with trust gone,
                Friday saw SVB go down. The regulators stepped in, with the FDIC acting as receiver in a clean-up
                exercise. An attempted auction process began over the weekend, seeking suitors.<br>
                There has already been a degree of market contagion, on fears of replication in other banks. All banks
                hold securities, for various reasons. In the traditional banking model, deposits raised are used to
                underwrite loans.<br>
                Banks have the option to invest in bonds as an alternative to writing loans, and this is most applicable
                where, for whatever reason, there is either not enough demand for loans, or the terms on writing loans
                are less appealing. Unusually, SVB employed far more of its deposit base in long-dated bonds than in
                writing loans. This meant it was more susceptible than most banks to the performance of its bond
                portfolio.<br>
                Moreover, SVB’s bond portfolio had a large longer-dated fixed-income component. As rates rise, the value
                of this portfolio fell. This would damage the running yield on such a portfolio, pressuring the implied
                interest rate margin down.<br>
                Under pressure, liquidation of the bond portfolio crystallised losses, necessitating the subsequent need
                to raise capital. Banks that hold either a lower proportion of bonds to loans (most do) and/or hold more
                of their securities in floating rates would be far less susceptible to an SVB-type repeat.<br>
                But that does not mean that there aren’t other SVBs out there. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in fact
                alluded to the possibility that there may indeed be some and that the Treasury was monitoring some other
                banks.<br>
                So far, it seems that the potential problem banks are few, and importantly do not extend to the
                so-called systemically important banks. But even if that’s the case, there is still a fear that
                contagion risks are uncomfortably elevated.<br>
                In the end, the banking system is a game of trust. So there needs to be some assurance that system
                breakdown risk is low. But crucially, we have assurance that system breakdown risk is low.<br>
