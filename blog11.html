            <h1>How K-pop became a global phenomenon</h1>
            <center>

            <p>Pop culture has grown in prominence to become a major driver of global culture, seen in everything from
                Korean dramas on Netflix to Korean skincare regimens dominating the cosmetics industry to delicious
                Korean tacos on your favorite local menu. And at the heart of Hallyu is the ever-growing popularity of
                K-pop — short, of course, for Korean pop music.<br>
                K-pop has become a truly global phenomenon thanks to its distinctive blend of addictive melodies, slick
                choreography and production values, and an endless parade of attractive South Korean performers who
                spend years in grueling studio systems learning to sing and dance in synchronized perfection.<br>
                Hallyu has been building for two decades, but K-pop in particular has become increasingly visible to
                global audiences in the past five to 10 years. South Korean artists have hit the Billboard Hot 100 chart
                at least eight times since the Wonder Girls first cracked it in 2009 with their crossover hit “Nobody” —
                released in four different languages, including English — and the export of K-pop has ballooned South
                Korea’s music industry to an impressive $5 billion industry.<br>
                Now, with South Korea hosting the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang at a moment of extremely
                heightened geopolitical tensions, K-pop has taken on a whole new kind of sociopolitical significance, as
                South Korea proudly displays its best-known export before the world<br>
                More than any other international music industry, K-pop has been strategically designed to earworm its
                way into your brain — and to elevate South Korea and its culture onto the world stage.
                How did we get here? Through a combination of global political changes, savvy corporatization and media
                management, and a heck of a lot of raw talent being ground through a very powerful stardom mill.<br>
                K-pop began in 1992 with one electric hip-hop performance<br>
                K-pop as we know it wouldn’t exist without democracy and television — specifically, South Korea’s
                reformation of its democratic government in 1987, with its accompanying modernization and lightening of
                censorship, and the effect this change had on television.<br>
                Prior to the establishment of the nation’s Sixth Republic, there were only two broadcast networks in the
                country, and they largely controlled what music South Koreans listened to; singers and musicians weren’t
                much more than tools of the networks. Networks introduced the public to musical stars primarily through
                weekend music talent shows. Radio existed but, like the TV networks, was under tight state control.<br>
                Independent music production didn’t really exist, and rock music was controversial and subject to
                banning; musicians and songs were primarily introduced to the public through the medium of the televised
                talent show, and radio served as little more than a subsidiary platform for entertainers who succeeded
                on those weekend TV competitions.<br>
                Before the liberalization of South Korean media in the late ‘80s, the music produced by broadcast
                networks was primarily either slow ballads or “trot,” a Lawrence Welk-ish fusion of traditional music
                with old pop standards. After 1987, though, the country’s radio broadcasting expanded rapidly, and South
                Koreans became more regularly exposed to more varieties of music from outside the country, including
                contemporary American music.<br>
                But TV was still the country’s dominant, centralized form of media: As of 1992, national TV networks had
                penetrated above 99 percent of South Korean homes, and viewership was highest on the weekends, when the
                talent shows took place. These televised talent shows were crucial in introducing music groups to South
                Korean audiences; they still have an enormous cultural impact and remain the single biggest factor in a
                South Korean band’s success.<br>
                As Moonrok editor Hannah Waitt points out in her excellent series on the history of K-pop, K-pop is
                unusual as a genre because it has a definitive start date, thanks to a band called Seo Taiji and Boys.
                Seo Taiji had previously been a member of the South Korean heavy metal band Sinawe, which was itself a
                brief but hugely influential part of the development of Korean rock music in the late ‘80s. After the
                band broke up, he turned to hip-hop and recruited two stellar South Korean dancers, Yang Hyun-suk and
                Lee Juno, to join him as backups in a group dubbed Seo Taiji and Boys. On April 11, 1992, they performed
                their single “Nan Arayo (I Know)” on a talent show:<br>
                Not only did the Boys not win the talent show, but the judges gave the band the lowest score of the
                evening. But immediately after the song debuted, “I Know” went on to top South Korea’s singles charts
                for a record-smashing 17 weeks, which would stand for more than 15 years as the longest No. 1 streak in
                the country’s history.<br>
                “I Know” represented the first time modern American-style pop music had been fused with South Korean
                culture. Seo Taiji and Boys were innovators who challenged norms around musical styles, song topics,
                fashion, and censorship. They sang about teen angst and the social pressure to succeed within a grueling
                education system, and insisted on creating their own music and writing their own songs outside of the
                manufactured network environment.<br>
                By the time Seo Taiji and Boys officially disbanded in 1996, they had changed South Korea’s musical and
                performance landscape, paving the way for other artists to be even more experimental and break even more
                boundaries — and for music studios to quickly step in and take over, forming an entire new studio system
                from the remnants of the broadcast-centered system.<br>
                Between 1995 and 1998, three powerhouse music studios appeared: SM Entertainment (often referred to as
                SM Town) in 1995; JYP Entertainment in 1997; and YG Entertainment in 1998, created by one of the members
                of Seo Taiji and Boys, Yang Hyun-suk. Together, these studios began deliberately cultivating what would
                become known as idol groups.<br>
                The first idol group in South Korea appeared on the scene in 1996, when SM founder Lee Soo-man created a
                group called H.O.T. by assembling five singers and dancers who represented what he believed teens wanted
                to see from a modern pop group.<br>
                There are three things that make K-pop such a visible and unique contributor to the realm of pop music:
                exceptionally high-quality performance (especially dancing), an extremely polished aesthetic, and an
                “in-house” method of studio production that churns out musical hits the way assembly lines churn out
                cars.<br>
                All of this emphasis on live performances make fans an extremely active part of the experience. K-pop
                fans have perfected the art of the fan chant, in which fans in live studio audiences and live
                performances will shout alternate fan chants over the musical intros to songs, and sometimes as a
                counterpoint to choruses, as a show of unity and support.This gradual evolution suggests that part of
                the reason K-pop has been able to make international inroads in recent years is that it’s been able to
                push against its own rigid norms, through the use of modern themes and sophisticated subtexts, without
                sacrificing the incredibly polished packaging that makes it so innately compelling. That would seem to
                be a formula for continued global success — especially now that South Korea and its culture has the
                world’s attention. Hallyu may swell or subside, but the K-pop production machine goes ever on. And from
                here, the future looks fantastic, baby<br>
