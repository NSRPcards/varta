            <p>Food and Indians have a unique relationship. The food market in India has grown steadily, and in 2018 it
                was valued at 3.7 trillion, with about 10 per cent annual growth. Casual dining restaurants andQSR(Quick
                Service Restaurants) account for more than 74 per cent of the market and are growing exponentially.<br>

                QSR, or Quick Service Restaurants, is a name of the industry for the fast food restaurants that offer
                you food that does not require much time for preparation and will be served instantly. It even costs you
                a minimum.<br>
                Why is the Quick Service Restaurant the future?<br>
                Until now, it may be pretty clear that QSR has come a long way and offers several benefits to the
                people. Undoubtedly, it will make the future bright because of the following factors.<br>
                1. Growth of the young population<br>
                India has a population with more than 50 per cent under 25 years and more than 65 per cent under 35
                years. India’s average age in 2020 is 29 years, compared to China’s average age of 37 years and Japan’s
                average age of 48 years. Young adults (18–35 years) enjoy eating out and even consider fast food to be
                delectable, and they spend a significant amount of their income on it. People in this age range are your
                ideal customers for the QSR chain which makes the growth of this sector more significant. People expect
                their food to arrive quickly when they visit a restaurant, and this is how these QSRs can profit.<br>
                2. Increase in per capita income<br>
                The Indian economy is growing rapidly at a 9.8 per cent CAGR, which fuels the country’s consumption. It
                has increased the number of times when Indians have food outside, that is about six times a month. And
                this number will increase and go up, backed by higher disposable income, which will also increase
                internet penetration.<br>
                3. Service of the internet in cosmopolitan cities<br>
                Now, the internet service has become more accessible than it ever was. Along with that, the online
                ordering window is also enhanced with time. Now tier-II and tier-III cities will have the same comfort
                and privilege. The quick-service restaurant is expanding its business, and even third-party vendors have
                spread their base in India.
