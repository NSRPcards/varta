            <p>Human rights have gained more attention & scrutiny in recent years, both domestically and internationally
                due to significant media coverage on several high-profile cases of human rights violations, such as
                Delhi gang rape case (violence against women), discrimination against marginalized communities like
                Dalits, etc., government’s use of sedition laws to restrict freedom of expression, Kashmir conflict in
                India, which sparked heavy public outrage.<br>
                This article focuses on human rights in Constitution, international human rights law, international and
                national cases on human rights violation, remedies & many more.<br>

                These are the constitutionally guaranteed human rights in India:<br>
                • Despite the constitutional protections, several instances of human rights violations have occurred in
                India like discrimination based on caste, gender, etc. , police brutality, custodial deaths & encounter
                killings.<br>
                • Some of the fundamental human rights provisions under the Indian Constitution are:<br>
                1. Right to Equality (Article 14-18): This guarantees equality before the law and prohibits
                discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth.<br>
                2. Right to Freedom (Article 19-22): This guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression,
                assembly, association, movement, and to practice any profession or occupation.<br>
                3. Right against Exploitation (Article 23-24): This prohibits trafficking, forced labor, and employment
                of children under the age of 14.<br>
                4. Right to Freedom of Religion (Article 25-28): This guarantees the freedom to profess, practice, and
                propagate any religion.<br>

                language, culture, and script, and to establish and administer educational institutions.<br>
                6. Right to Life and Personal Liberty (Article 21): This guarantees the right to life and personal

                the enforcement of fundamental rights.<br>
                • No doubt, the Indian government has taken steps to address human rights violations, like the
                establishment of the NHRC.<br>
                Know the difference between human rights and fundamental rights in this article
                Human rights violation in India<br>
                There have been various cases of human rights violations reported in India. Here are some examples of
                human rights violations cases in India:<br>
                1. Discrimination against marginalized communities: Several cases have been reported on discrimination
                against marginalized communities, including Dalits (formerly known as "untouchables"), indigenous
                people, and religious minorities. in education, employment, and access to healthcare.<br>
                2. Violence against women: There have been several incidences of sexual harassment, rape, and domestic
                violence against women in India. The biggest example is the Nirbhaya case which sparked nationwide
                protests. The accused were given death sentence & this case led to legal reforms including Criminal law
                (Amendment) Act, 2013.<br>
                3. Custodial deaths: There have been reports of police brutality, torture in India mainly to extract
                confessions. Custodial deaths (deaths that occur in police custody) have been a longstanding human
                rights issue in India. However the SC in 2014 issued guidelines to prevent custodial deaths and torture
                by including medical examinations of prisoners and creating an independent authority to investigate
                custodial violence complaints.<br>
                4. Extrajudicial killings- Encounter killings or police encounters refer to situations where the police
                or security forces involve extrajudicial killings of generally suspects individuals. These encounters
                are often referred to as "fake encounters" as they are mostly staged to appear as if the suspects were
                killed in self-defence, which is not in reality..<br>
                5. Abuses of power by government officials: There have been several incidences of abuses of power by
                government officials, like corruption, nepotism, and harassment of whistleblowers.
                International cases of human rights violation<br>
                There have been numerous international cases of human rights violations worldwide, let’s wrap few of
                them:<br>
                1. Afghanistan- Taliban issue- The Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021 raised serious
                concerns about human rights violations in the country. The Taliban had a history of committing serious
                human rights abuses, like targeting women and minorities, extrajudicial killings and torture.After
                taking control of Afghanistan, the Taliban promised to respect human rights.UN & human rights groups,
                have called on the Taliban to respect human rights. It is yet to be seen if Taliban maintains its
                promise to respect human rights.<br>
                2. Rohingya crisis in Myanmar: The Rohingya people, a Muslim minority group in Myanmar, faced
                persecution and violence for a very long period of time and in 2017, the Myanmar military launched a
                brutal crackdown on the Rohingya, resulting in thousands of deaths & displacement. UN said that the
                violence is ethnic cleansing and genocide.<br>
                3. Syrian civil war: This war began in 2011 which led to a widespread human rights violations, including
                the use of chemical weapons, torture, and attacks on civilians. The conflict has displaced millions of
                people and generated a humanitarian crisis.<br>
                4. Chinese govt. Towards Uyghurs: The Chinese government has been accused of committing human rights
                violations against the Uyghur minority group in the Xinjiang region, resulting in arbitrary detention,
                forced labor, and cultural genocide. UN with other countries called for an end to the abuses.
                5. Israel-Palestine conflict: The conflict between Israel and Palestine gained immense attention, with
                both sides accused of committing human rights violations. These violations include attacks on civilians,
                arbitrary detention & restrictions on freedom of movement.<br>
                India & International human rights law<br>
                • India is a signatory to various international human rights instruments, including the Universal
                Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and its two covenants; the International Covenant on Civil and
                Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It is also a
                member of the United Nations Human Rights Council <br>
                • India, in order to comply with these international standards and apply these international provisions
                domestically, has implemented various laws, policies, and programs aimed at protecting and promoting
                human rights via its Constitution and Human Rights Act.<br>
                • Say, India has enacted laws to protect the rights of women, children, and marginalized communities,
                and has established institutions like the National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission
                for Women.<br>
                • However, India is also criticized for not complying with international human rights obligations, say
                treatment of minority communities etc.<br>
                What is Universal Declaration of Human Rights?<br>
                The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a historic document adopted by the United Nations
                General Assembly on 10th December, 1948 which outlines the fundamental human rights and freedoms crucial
                to all individuals.<br>
                • The UDHR consists of 30 articles which describes several human rights, such as the right to life,
                liberty, and security of person, the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, the right to
                education, the right to work and equal pay for equal work etc.<br>
                • The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a declaration and not a legally binding treaty.<br>
                • However, UDHR has now been a part of customary international law as countries have widely recognized
                it as a landmark achievement in the history of human rights, so all the countries need to comply with
                the international human rights standards.<br>
                • UDHR has been translated into over 500 languages and has served as the basis for developing
                international human rights treaties and agreements.<br>
                International Covenants of UDHR<br>
                Two international covenants adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1966 are based on the
                principles of the UDHR and have been ratified by many countries. These covenants are:<br>
                1. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR): This covenant recognizes the civil and
                political rights of individuals, including the right to life, freedom of speech and assembly, freedom of
                religion, & the right to a fair trial, prohibiting torture, slavery, and arbitrary detention.<br>
                2. International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR): This covenant recognizes the
                economic, social, and cultural rights of individuals, including the right to work, education, health,
                and an adequate standard of living & recognizes the right to form and join trade unions & the right to
                access to scientific progress.<br>
                Both the ICCPR and the ICESCR require states to take measures to protect and promote the rights
                enshrined in the covenants. States that have ratified these covenants are legally bound to respect,
                protect, and fulfil these rights.<br>
                What to do if human rights are violated?<br>
                Here are a few remedies:<br>
                1. Legal action: Individuals or groups whose human rights have been violated may seek remedy via
                national courts or tribunals. This may involve filing a lawsuit or lodging a complaint with a human
                rights commission (state or national) or ombudsman. In some cases, international courts or tribunals may
                have jurisdiction over human rights violations committed by state actors.<br>
                2. Political action: Individuals or groups may seek political remedies by advocating and working hard
                towards bringing the human rights violations into limelight via media coverage & pressure governments or
                other actors to take action to address them such as via petitions, forms etc.<br>
                3. International human rights bodies: Individuals or groups may seek remedies via international human
                rights bodies, like the United Nations Human Rights Council or the International Criminal Court. These
                bodies have the authority to investigate human rights violations. One can approach these bodies through
                NGOs working in their states.<br>
                4. Humanitarian aid and support: In cases where individuals or groups have been displaced or otherwise
                affected by human rights violations, humanitarian aid and support may be provided to help meet their
                basic needs. It can be given by govts. NGOs, individual donors, UNO etc.<br>
                5. However, the effectiveness of these remedies can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each
                & every case.<br>
                Conclusion:<br>
                India has a complex and diverse society, with a population of over 1.3 billion people, & a different
                cultures, religions, socio-economic backgrounds. Protection of human rights in such a large and diverse
                country can be a challenging task, however, there are several measures that the Indian government has
                taken to ensure the protection of human rights such as constitutional safeguards, legal reforms like
                amendment in rape laws, civil society activism along with international human rights instruments.<br>
