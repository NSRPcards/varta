            <p>Thousands of people have been killed in Hindu- Muslim communal violence/ riots since 1950s as our
                independent India is yet to see a violence- free nation . The conflict between these communities in our
                country is absolutely communal. But what causes communal riots in India? India is dominant with two
                major communities, Hindus & Muslims, wherein the Muslim community in India is the second largest
                community, that is, nearly 200 million Muslims after Hindus. So, the cases of violence between them is
                not very uncommon. This article deals with the riots in India with particular references to the
                demolition of the Babri Masjid in 1992 and the genocide of Muslims in Gujarat riots in 2002 etc.<br>
                What is Riots?<br>
                A riot is a type of civil disorder which commonly refers to a group lashing out in a violent public
                disturbance against the authority, property, or people and. communal riots or communal violence are
                simply clashes between two or more communities owing to clashes of communal interests, this also leads
                to violent public disturbance.<br>
                Let’s go through communal violence in detail.<br>
                • Religious violence during the India’s partition claimed over a million lives and displaced around 10
                million people. The religious violence comprising Hindu-Muslim communities rose to a deadlier number for
                about a quarter century in the late 1970s until 2002, when the Gujarat riots happened.<br>
                • Official records provides that communal violence has been relatively stable since 2002. However, more
                than 2,900 cases of religious rioting were registered in the country between 2017 & 2021.<br>
                • Looking at the record of 2021, Haryana recorded the highest communal violence cases that, is about 8
                riot cases per 100,000 inhabitants.<br>
                • In 2023, as per the records, electoral violence & high-profile political assassinations have declined
                significantly in India; even violence at polling stations fell, and deaths in such cases declined by 70%
                between 1989 & 2019.<br>
                • The most famous cases were the two prime ministers’ assassinations- Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv
                Gandhi in 1984 and 1991, respectively.<br>

                Reasons of Communal Violence<br>
                • Historical factors-The partition history of India, and the two-nation theory generated the feeling of
                communalism & mistrust among communities.<br>
                • Political factors-The divide and rule policy by the Britishers, and the later identity politics
                followed by the political parties have supported communal violence.<br>
                • Educational factors- Many Indians have failed to adopt a scientific and technological approach and
                couldn’t adopt much to liberal values.<br>
                • Socio-economic factors-The educational backwardness has led in poor representation of Muslim community
                in public services which contains the seeds of communal violence between the communities.<br>
                • Cultural factors- Orthodox members of communities supports conservatism & fundamentalism.<br>
                • Social media- Hate campaigns and fake news contributes to a much greater extent towards spreading
                communal riots and tensions.<br>
                • Lack of strong action- Lack of strong, decisive action by police or delayed action are also the
                reasons.<br>
                Timeline of Communal violence in India<br>
                1. 1983: Nellie massacre<br>
                On February 18th, 1983, thousands of Bengal-origin Muslims were massacred near Nellie in central Assam.
                2,000+ Muslims were labeled as foreigners who were assassinated. This violence continued for 6 hours.
                Many people believes that the massacre was the way in which the people of the Nogaon District, including
                the tribal's and other Assamese population, demonstrated their resentment against the East Bengal
                originated Muslim population. It is also argued that these Muslim population supposedly encroached upon
                their land as well.<br>
                2. 1984: Anti-Sikh riots<br>
                Many years have passed since the 1984 riots, but the shadows of those terrifying incidents are still
                witnessed on the faces of affected families. Constantly for 5 days from Oct 31st, reports states that
                around 2,800 to 8,000 Sikhs were assassinated across India. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was shot dead
                by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31st, 1984, after which anti-Sikh riots erupted in few areas for
                several days, assassinating more Sikhs across India.<br>
                The reason for Indira’s assassination was Operation Blue Star. In the deadly events leading up to
                ‘Operation Blue Star’ ordered by Indira Gandhi, the militants supported by Bhindranwale assassinated
                around 165 Hindus in India.<br>
                3. 1992-1993: Babri Masjid demolition/ Bombay riots<br>
                Hindu mobs attacked and destroyed the historical Babri Mosque in Ayodhya city of UP. A decade long
                unsettled political and communal land dispute was finally decided on Nov 9, 2019, in a unanimous
                judgment by the 5-judge bench of the Apex Court. This was the first that a constitutional bench judged a
                civil dispute than 2 judge bench. Thereafter again first in its nature, where verdict didn’t carry the
                name of the authors, then it was read out in the open court by the CJI and not the lead author.<br>
                The constitutional bench of Supreme Court gave a unanimous judgment permitting the construction of
                temple at the site where once stood the Babri Masjid. It granted the entire 2.77 acre of disputed land
                in Ayodhya to deity Ram Lalla. SC also said that there should be alternate land given to Muslims to make
                good their loss of a mosque.<br>
                4. 2002: Gujarat riots<br>
                On February 27th, 2002, 59 Hindu pilgrims and karsevaks returning from Ayodhya were killed in a fire
                inside the Sabarmati Express near the Godhra railway station in Gujarat, PM Modi was the CM of Gujarat
                at that time. The background of this incident is that as the train pulled away, someone pulled the
                emergency brake cord when it was passing through a Muslim neighbourhood & a Muslim mob attacked the
                train at that time in, which two carriages were burnt. The incident led to riots in Gujarat that lasted
                seven days, leaving over a 1,000 dead. The victims were primarily Muslims<br>
                This was the incident wherein Bilkis Bano, who was 19 years old back then, was gangraped in Gujarat's
                Randhikpur village and 7 family members, including her 3-year-old daughter, were killed on March 3,
                2002, during the riots.<br>
                Constitutional Provisions<br>
                • The Preamble of our Indian Constitution declares it as a secular state and secures the liberty of
                thought expression, belief faith, and worship.<br>
                • Article 25- All persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess,
                practice, and propagate religion subject to public order, morality, and health.<br>
                • Article 26- All denominations can manage their own affairs in every matters of religion.<br>
                • Article 29- No discrimination would be done on the ground of religion, race, caste, language, or any
                of them.<br>
                • Article 30- All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish
                and administer educational institutions of their choice.<br>
                • Art 51A- This is a fundamental duty that promotes harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst
                all the people of India transcending religious, linguistic, and regional or sectional diversities and to
                renounce practices derogatory to the dignity of women.<br>
                Legal Provisions<br>
                • Several sections of the Indian penal code deals with the issues of communalism in the country, like
                section 153A, 153B<br>
                • The communal Violence (Prevention, Control, and Rehabilitation of Victims) Bill, 2005, was to be
                enacted, but it didn’t. So, the Union Cabinet approved the Prevention of Communal Violence (Access to
                Justice and Reparations) Bill, 2004, which never came to the House, and now there has been no talk of
                the law since.<br>
                • Manipur government was the first state to come up with its law against lynching in 2018.<br>
                Conclusion<br>
                Communal violence can be curbed by Impartial administration and directives of police reforms by the
                Supreme Court, which the state government must adopt. Setting up of peace committees should be made
                compulsory in every area. Civil societies or NGOs must help in restoring faith of common people in the
                local police<br>
