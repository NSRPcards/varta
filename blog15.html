                -Swami Vivekananda <br>
                Swami Vivekananda, “originally Narendranath Datta”, was born in Calcutta on January 12th, 1863. He was a
                Hindu spiritual leader and Indian reformer whose birthday is celebrated as ‘International Youth Day’.<br>
                This day's main aim is to ignite, motivate & activate India’s youths towards nation-building. He was
                admitted to the school founded by Mr. Ishwarchandra Vidyasagar in 1870.<br>
                Swami Vivekananda had immense respect for his mother tongue. One such incident was when he attended an
                English language class in school, he said, “I shall not learn the language of the white master.” But
                ultimately, he learnt English due to compulsion. Later, he joined the Presidency College in Kolkata and
                completed his M.A. in Philosophy. This article discusses his autobiography, famous lines, institutions
                founded by him and many more from a competitive exams point of view. So let’s get started.<br>

                Swami Vivekananda’s first speech<br>
                Swami Vivekananda, when he he came to know about the World Parliament that was held in Chicago, America,
                wanted to attend the meeting to represent India and his Guru's philosophies. So, on 11 September 1893,
                he came upon the stage and shocked everyone by saying, "My brothers and sisters of America". For this
                line, he received a standing ovation from the audience. He deliberated the principles of Vedanta, its
                spiritual importance, and many more. His speech beautifully demonstrated our Indian culture.<br>
                He stayed for two and a half years in America & founded the Vedanta Society of New York. He even
                travelled to the United Kingdom to preach the principles & philosophies of Vedanta. So, beautifully he
                said: “Learn everything that is good from others but bring it in, and in your own way absorb it; do not
                become others.”<br>
                Who was the founder of Ramakrishna Mission?<br>
                He returned to India around 1897 & reached Calcutta, where he founded Ramakrishna Mission on 1st May
                1897 at Belur Math. The mission's objectives were based on Karma Yoga, and its main goal was to serve
                India's poor or disturbed population. This mission included other activities like establishing schools,
                colleges, and hospitals.<br>
                • Swami Vivekananda is remembered for introducing philosophies like Vedanta and Yoga to the West.<br>
                • His Vedanta teachings were showered through conferences, seminars, workshops, and rehabilitation work
                across the country.<br>
                • Swami Vivekananda and Taraknath, another disciple of Ramkrishna Paramhansa, established the Mission
                subsequent to the Mahasamadhi of Shri Ramkrishna Paramhansa.<br>
                • A place believed to be a haunted house earlier was used for beginning the mission activities. Soon
                Shri Ramkrishna’s disciples started living there.<br>
                Famous quotes by Swami Vivekananda<br>
                “Arise, awake and stop not until the goal is achieved"<br>
                “Be an atheist if you want, but do not believe in anything unquestioningly.”-<br>
                “Take risks in your life. If you win, you can lead, if you lose, you can guide.”<br>
                “Learn everything that is good from others but bring it in, and in your own way absorb it; do not become
                others.”<br>
                “A man is not poor without a rupee, but a man is really poor without a dream and ambition”
