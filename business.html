                    <h4>Revenue model of insurance company</h4>
                    <p>Insurance company payouts... We’ve seen the dramatic presentation of these in various media where
                        someone’s life is put in peril to release a massive payday in the form of insurance ke paise or
                        we see the “besahara family” looking for respite in the form of insurance ke paise.
                        Well these portrayals are rather single-dimensional, as a lot of insurance payouts are a lot
                        less dramatic and do not only cover the loss of value to an unfortunate passing of a person.
                        Another aspect that isn’t as glamorous </p>

                    <h4>Indian weddings:Financial Nightmare or Business Heaven</h4>
                    <p>As the Covid restrictions die down, the Indian wedding season is returning with a vengeance. Based on a survey involving 35 cities and 4,302 service providers, the Confederation of All Indian Traders (CAIT) secretary general Praveen Khandelwal has projected 35 lakh weddings worth ₹3.75 lakh crore. These projections are for the period from November 4th to December 14th.
                        This is an increase from last year’s 25 lakh weddings worth ₹3 lakh crore. This means that the number of weddings is expected to go up by 28% and the money spent by 25%.
                        So, the “big fat Indian wedding” will only get bigger, but not really fat, as the pandemic sent it on a diet.</p>

                    <h4>Boom of Entrepreneurship in India</h4>
                    <p>he booming entrepreneurship culture in India is a relatively recent phenomenon, having taken off in the early 2000s. This is largely due to the growth of the Indian economy, which has opened up more opportunities for entrepreneurs to start their own businesses. The availability of venture capital, the emergence of incubators, and the availability of a large pool of talented individuals have all contributed to the growth of entrepreneurship in India.
                        As you read this, are you curious about what it means to be an entrepreneur?</p>
